## What is Plotly

Plotly is an open source Graphing Library works with a number of coding languages and is designed to make interactive graphs that can be displayed in HTML

It works with several coding languages:

- R
- Python
- Java Script

## In R

Calling the plotly package allows 2 main ways to create Plotly Graphics

1. via GGPlot by passing a created ggplot to a function called ggplotly
2. Via plotly's own graphing process that is similar to ggplot

## GGPLOT vs Plotly Similarities
In R there are many similarities between how Plotly and GGPLOT charts are put together.

```{r gg v plotly, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, paged.print=TRUE}
require(data.table)
sims <- data.table(ggplot = c("ggplot()","ggtitle(), labels_*", "geom_*" ), plotly = c("plot_ly", "layout()", "add_trace()"), Similarjob = c("Maps R object to the the graphing library", "Allows for changes to the layout and titles of the chart","determins type of chart such as histogram and other factors"))

require(DT)
datatable(sims)
```

## GGPLOT to Plotly Example
```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
require(ggplot2)
require(tidyverse)
require(plotly)
data <- fread("J:/My Drive/Graduate School/IST719 Vizualization/Files for Class from 2U/wine.txt")
```


```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
g <- ggplot(data = data)+aes(x=units.sold, y = income, color = wine,pch = type)+
  geom_point()+ggtitle("Example Plot")
ggplotly(g) %>% layout()
```

## Directly in Plotly
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_ly(data = data, x= ~units.sold, y= ~income,
        color = ~wine, symbol = ~type) %>% 
  layout(title = " A quick Plotly Graph")
```

## Using multiple traces
```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
plot_ly(data = data, x= ~factor(wine), y = ~income, type = 'scatter',
       name = 'scatterplot') %>% add_boxplot(name = "boxplot") %>% 
  layout(title = 'Layed Wine Chart')
```

## Maps
Plotly also provides a large number of realtively easy options for creating maps via base data frames. Here are some of the options:

## Buttons and Other Notes

Plotly, as part of the interactive promise, offers the ability to create additional items:
